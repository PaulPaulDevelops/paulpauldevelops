Ask me anything about anything about __Ionic, Cordova, or Capacitor!__

I am an [Ionic Developer Expert](https://ionic.io/community) and have been creating/publishing mobile applications using Ionic since _Ionic 1 Beta_.

Don't want to talk about dev? Let me know an answer to any of these questions:
- What is the best PokÃ©mon game? 
- Should pineapple go on a pizza?
- Is a burrito a sandwich?
